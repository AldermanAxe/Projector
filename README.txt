A user interface for javascript objects and javascript development environment, implemented as a web page. In one sense the tool is just an interface for interacting with and modifying any javascript object. Any valid object literal should be convertable by the tool into an interface. 

It is intended to provide an easy to use interface for executing and modifying a collection of user-designed functions, which may interact.

The intent of the design is to allow the user to add any functionality permitted by the web browser and hardware, so the user should have the ability to customize everything. 

The program is implemented as an HTML file with javascript, to allow it to be run from any machine with a modern web browser, whether it is connected to the internet or not. The program allows saving changes to an local HTML file, or to the Web Browser, or to a server.

It enables building tools to record, process, and share information, which can implement apps like project organizers, note keepers, schedulers.

Predicated on the continued advancement of web functionality, peer to peer communication, and web APIs, toward democratization of information and automation.

The tool must be flexible and configurable. It should be easy to run in any way - from a server, locally, adding a parameter with a new project object etc.

Since javascript objects are turing complete, the tool is as well.
