A tool to record, process, and share information. 

A sort of project organizer, note keeper, scheduler.

The program is implemented as an HTML file with javascript, to allow it to be run from any machine with a modern web browser, whether it is connected to the internet or not.

The program allows saving changes to an updated HTML file, or to the Web Browser, or to a server.

The intent of the design is to allow the user to add any functionality permitted by the web browser and hardware, so the user should have the ability to customize everything. 

It is intended to provide an easy to use interface for executing and modifying a collection of user-designed functions, which may interact.

The tool must be flexible and configurable. It should be easy to run in any way - from a server, locally, addinga parameter with a new project object etc.

In a sense the tool is just an interface for interacting with any javascript object. Any valid object literal should be convertable by the tool into an interface. Since javascript objects are turing complete, the tool is as well.

Previous versions should be logged and backed up so we can get back to prior versions
